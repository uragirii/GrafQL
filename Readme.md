# GrafQL

_A distant cousin of GraphQL_

## The Idea Behind

When I learnt about GraphQL, a query language for API and a potential replacement of REST APIs, I was intrigued. GraphQL has a very easy idea, just ask for data you need. You can also ask for multiple Objects and perform `mutations` and `queries` in same request.

For me, GraphQL is a nice concept and an obvious evolution of REST APIs. But at the same time confusing and hard(?).But GrapQL just shifts all the logic to server end. When I learnt about the concept I thought, "Huh, that's it? I wonder why we need graphql library for this?". It should be easy to use.

So, in this repository I'm trying to create my own implementation of GrapQL, using HTTP POST verb and some backend processing. I don't hope to make a full-fleged server library just some Proof of Concept that GraphQL is not something specific to the graphql libraries, anyone can create and use, but obviously those libraries would be much more perfomance optimised and secure to use.

**Please don't use this in production**
